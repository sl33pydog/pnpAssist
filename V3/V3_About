This version is a take on the V2 with several key differences (in no particular order).

1.  Attempt to lower the part count
2.  Create a stronger structure
3.  Create a version that is thinner than previous versions (less tall)
4.  Incorporates the same motion system (1 axis of linear movement with 1 rotation axis)
5.  Make sure there is a clear path for wiring.
6.  Allows for the same footprint motherboard that V1 and V2 share.
7.  Allows for a different aethestic approach.
8.  Keeps the same carousel system.

What I couldn't accomplish:

1. Keep the whole system made from 3D printed parts and 1 sheet metal plate.  Reason:  I believe that L bracket angles or a two plate
approach helps strengthen the core, prevent overal system flex and also eliminates off axis binding on the pulleys.
2.  I couldn't make it any thinner than it was originally in V2.  Reason:  The shaft of the stepper motor is at a fixed height.  There 
is a potential to use the aesthetic pieces to hide this but right now it can't get nay thinner from the top plate of V2 to the bottom of the steppers
motors.

This is a work in progress.  I will be adding everything in a step assembly file.  Once this fork gets pulled into the main project then each part will be exported in
Assembly space so that it's easier to incorporate into actual cad parts in an assembly.

This fork is being worked on by Clayton Harp.  All licenses from pnpassist apply to this version as well.
